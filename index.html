			<h4>Objective</h4>
			<p>To gain acceptance to Prime Academy</p>
			<h4>Past Work Experience</h4>
			<p>T-mobile (2014 - Present)</p>
			<p>I help connect customers with T-Mobiles fantastic lineup of cellular devices and ensure that they have the "complete experience." Sometimes I'll sit with a customer for over an hour making sure they fully understand how to work their new device and that it is a right fit for them. I am in love with the T-Mobile brand and what it represents within the wireless industry. At work, I don't just sell phones. I create a relationship with my team and my customers and connect them with a product that I believe in.  Currently on a Leadership development plan, a typical day involves analyzing a stores sales growth and statistics and formulating a strategy tailored to specific opportunities. I work closely with my peers to develop performance and drive initiatives from T-Mobile Leadership.
